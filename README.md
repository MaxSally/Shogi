# A simple Shogi board

At current iteration, the following has been implemented:
1. piece images (obtained from Wikipedia)
2. chess board
3. piece movement
4. piece capture
5. piece promotion (with respective image changes)

Future iterations:
1. Drop piece: another action in shogi that allows you to re-play captured pieces onto the board.
2. Checkmate and end screen.
